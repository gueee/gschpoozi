# gschpoozi

> A simple, wizard-based Klipper configuration generator.

---

## Beta Software

This software is in beta. While core functionality is stable, some hardware combinations may require manual adjustments.

**Before using generated configs:**
- Review generated files and verify pin assignments match your wiring
- Backup your existing printer.cfg
- Test with `STEPPER_BUZZ` before homing
- Be ready to hit emergency stop on first home

**Known Limitations:**
- Stepper/motor discovery is not integrated/reliable yet — assume you must already know which motor is on which driver/port
- Macro setup (START_PRINT / END_PRINT / macro defaults) is not fully tested across printers yet — review generated macros before relying on them
- Manual verification of motor directions is required (do this before homing)

---

**gschpoozi** makes setting up Klipper easy. Instead of copying and editing complex config files, run the wizard, answer questions about your printer, and get a clean, working configuration.

Inspired by [Klippain](https://github.com/Frix-x/klippain), but built from the ground up with simplicity as the #1 priority.

## Features

- **Interactive Wizard** - Step-by-step setup, no config editing required
- **Port-Based Hardware Setup** - Visual pin assignment for any board
- **Clean Output** - Generates readable, well-commented config files
- **Safe Updates** - Your customizations are never overwritten
- **Modular Design** - Only generates what you actually need

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
cd ~ && git clone https://github.com/gm-tc-collaborators/gschpoozi.git

# 2. Run the configuration wizard
~/gschpoozi/scripts/configure.sh

# 3. Follow the prompts to configure your printer

# 4. Done! Your config is ready in ~/printer_data/config/
```

## How It Works

The wizard guides you through your hardware setup:

1. **Toolhead Board** - Optional (EBB36, SHT36, etc.)
2. **Kinematics** - CoreXY, Cartesian + Z motor count
3. **Stepper Drivers** - Per-axis driver selection
4. **Main Board** - Controller board with port assignment
5. **Extruder, Bed, Probe** - Temperature and sensor config
6. **Extras** - Filament sensor, LEDs, chamber heating

Then generates clean config files:

```
~/printer_data/config/
├── printer.cfg           # Your file - includes + overrides + SAVE_CONFIG
└── gschpoozi/            # Generated configs (managed by wizard)
    ├── hardware.cfg      # MCU, steppers, heaters, fans
    ├── macros.cfg        # PRINT_START, PRINT_END, etc.
    └── homing.cfg        # Homing and bed mesh
```

## File Structure

**`printer.cfg`** - Your main config file. This is where you:
- Add the `[include gschpoozi/...]` lines
- Put your overrides and customizations
- Klipper writes `SAVE_CONFIG` here

**`gschpoozi/` folder** - Generated by the wizard. Contains:
- Hardware definitions (pins, steppers, heaters)
- Macros (PRINT_START, PRINT_END, etc.)
- Homing routines

## Documentation

For complete documentation, see:
- **[Usage Manual](docs/USAGE.md)** - Detailed guide for all wizard options
- **[Klipper Config Guidelines](KLIPPER_CONFIG_GUIDELINES.md)** - Klipper syntax reference

## Automatic Updates

The wizard automatically adds gschpoozi to your Moonraker Update Manager. After setup, you'll see gschpoozi in your update list and can update it like any other component.

Updates only affect the gschpoozi repository itself. Your generated configs and `printer.cfg` are **never overwritten**.

**If Update Manager hangs or doesn't show updates**, use manual update:
```bash
cd ~/gschpoozi && git pull
```

See [Troubleshooting](docs/USAGE.md#update-manager-issues) for more options.

## Re-running the Wizard

Need to change something? Just run the wizard again:

```bash
~/gschpoozi/scripts/configure.sh
```

Your previous selections are saved, so you can quickly adjust and regenerate.

## Customization

Add your customizations to `printer.cfg` after the includes:

```ini
[include gschpoozi/hardware.cfg]
[include gschpoozi/macros.cfg]
[include gschpoozi/homing.cfg]

# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# YOUR OVERRIDES BELOW
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════

[extruder]
pressure_advance: 0.045    # Your calibrated value

[gcode_macro PRINT_START]
variable_my_var: 100       # Add your own variables
```
